# Phase 2 Implementation - Progress Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Phase 2A - 50% Complete
**Branch**: `development`

### 2. Phase 2A Backend Foundation (50% Complete)

**Files Modified**: `index.js`

**Architecture Changes:**

#### Asset Structure Enhanced:
```javascript
// NEW: Batch tracking system added
{
  market: "BTC-EUR",
  currentState: "buy" | "sell",
  lastPrices: [],
  latestPrice: null,

  // V2.0 Phase 2: Multi-batch system
  batches: [
    {
      batchId: "batch_1697123456789",
      buyPrice: 104500,
      buyAmount: 50,
      cryptoAmount: 0.000478,
      remainingCrypto: 0.000478,
      remainingPercent: 100,
      maxPrice: 104500,
      waitIndex: 0,
      status: "active",
      sellSteps: [...],  // Configured steps
      stopLoss: {...}    // Per-batch stop-loss
    }
  ],

  // Legacy fields (maintained for compatibility)
  buyPrice: 104500,
  maxPrice: 104500,
  cryptoAmount: 0.000478
}
```

#### Helper Functions Implemented:

**1. createSellSteps(stepConfig, buyPrice)**
- Converts user configuration into sell step objects
- Calculates target prices based on buy price + threshold
- Returns structured array of step objects

**2. createStopLoss(buyPrice, percentage)**
- Creates stop-loss configuration for each batch
- Default 15% loss trigger
- Calculates exact trigger price

**3. calculateTotalCrypto(batches)**
- Sums remaining crypto across all active batches
- Filters out completed batches
- Updates legacy `cryptoAmount` field

**4. checkPriceDropPattern(lastPrices, currentPrice)**
- Detects price drops for sell trigger
- Checks -0.3%, -0.4%, -0.5% drops
- Uses historical price comparison

#### Buy Logic Refactored:

**Before (V1.0):**
```javascript
async function buy(asset, reason, cp) {
  // Execute buy order
  asset.buyPrice = cp;
  asset.cryptoAmount = (buyAmount / cp);
  // Single position
}
```

**After (V2.0):**
```javascript
async function buy(asset, reason, cp) {
  // Execute buy order
  let cryptoAmount = /* buy execution */;

  // Create new batch
  const batch = {
    batchId: `batch_${Date.now()}`,
    buyPrice: cp,
    buyAmount: buyAmount,
    cryptoAmount: cryptoAmount,
    remainingCrypto: cryptoAmount,
    remainingPercent: 100,
    sellSteps: tradingConfig.multiStepEnabled
      ? createSellSteps(tradingConfig.sellSteps, cp)
      : null,
    stopLoss: createStopLoss(cp, 15),
    status: "active"
  };

  asset.batches.push(batch);

  // Update legacy fields for compatibility
  asset.buyPrice = cp;
  asset.cryptoAmount = calculateTotalCrypto(asset.batches);

  // Emit batch creation event
  io.emit('batch-created', {...});
}
```

**Configuration Storage:**
```javascript
// Trading config stored for buy operations
const tradingConfig = {
  buyAmount,
  tradingMode,
  multiStepEnabled: multiStepEnabled || false,
  sellSteps: sellSteps || null
};
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
- ✅ Legacy fields still updated (buyPrice, cryptoAmount, maxPrice)
- ✅ Existing interval-based selling unaffected
- ✅ No breaking changes to current workflow
- ✅ Batches array initialized only when needed

**Commits:**
- `832eb64` - Phase 2A Part 1: Add batch structure and refactor buy logic

## 🔄 In Progress

### Phase 2A Backend - Sell Logic (Next Steps)

**Remaining Functions to Implement:**

#### 1. processSellLogic(asset, currentPrice)
- Iterates through all active batches
- Updates maxPrice per batch
- Routes to multi-step or traditional sell logic
- Checks stop-loss for each batch
- Cleans up completed batches

#### 2. processMultiStepSell(asset, batch, currentPrice)
- Finds next uncompleted sell step
- Checks if profit target reached
- Validates price drop pattern (sell trigger)
- Executes partial sell for the step
- Validates €5 minimum (skips if too small)
- Updates batch and step status
- Emits events to frontend

#### 3. checkStopLoss(asset, batch, currentPrice)
- Calculates loss percentage
- Triggers if loss >= -15%
- Sells all remaining crypto in batch
- Marks batch as completed
- Emits stop-loss event

#### 4. executeSell(asset, cryptoAmount, currentPrice)
- Shared function for all sell operations
- Handles both real and test mode
- Executes Bitvavo API call (real mode)
- Simulates with fees (test mode)
- Updates wallet
- Returns EUR received

#### 5. Update processAssetPrice()
- Replace old sell logic with processSellLogic()
- Check if all batches completed → return to BUY state
- Maintain backward compatibility

## 📊 Testing Plan

### Phase 2A Tests (To Be Executed)

1. **Single Batch, Single Step**
   - Configure 1 step: 100% at 2% profit
   - Buy and wait for 2% gain
   - Verify sell executes correctly

2. **Single Batch, Multi-Step**
   - Configure 3 steps: 33%/33%/34% at 1.2%/2.0%/4.0%
   - Buy and wait for price increases
   - Verify steps execute in order
   - Verify amounts correct after each step

3. **Stop-Loss**
   - Buy at price X
   - Wait for -15% drop
   - Verify entire batch sold

4. **Minimum Trade Validation**
   - Buy €15 with 10% steps
   - Verify steps < €5 are skipped
   - Console shows skip messages

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Use interval-based selling (not multi-step)
   - Verify old behavior still works
   - Verify batch system doesn't interfere

## 📈 Architecture Summary

### V1.0 → V2.0 Evolution

**V1.0 (Before):**
```
Asset → Single Position → Sell All → Repeat
```

**V2.0 (After):**
```
Asset → Multiple Batches → Partial Sells per Batch
  ↓

Batch 2: 100% remaining
Batch 3: Completed
```

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ Multiple concurrent positions per asset

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Important Considerations:

1. **Floating Point Precision**
   - Crypto amounts are very small (8 decimals)
   - Use `.toFixed(8)` for crypto amounts
   - Use `.toFixed(2)` for EUR amounts

2. **Bitvavo API Constraints**
   - Minimum €5 per trade (after fees)
   - 0.25% fee rate
   - Rate limiting may affect rapid sells

3. **State Management**
   - Legacy fields maintained for compatibility
   - Both old and new systems run in parallel
   - Frontend must handle both batch and non-batch modes

4. **Event Emissions**
   - New events: batch-created, multi-step-sell, stop-loss
   - Frontend must listen for these events
   - Real-time updates critical for UX

## ✨ Summary

Phase 2 implementation is progressing excellently. The UI is complete and tested, and the backend foundation (buy logic + batch system) is solid. The remaining work focuses on the sell logic implementation, which is the most complex part but follows a clear plan.

The architecture maintains full backward compatibility while adding powerful new capabilities. Once Phase 2A is complete, the bot will support sophisticated multi-step selling strategies that can significantly improve trading performance and risk management.

**Next Session**: Continue with sell logic implementation (processSellLogic, processMultiStepSell, checkStopLoss, executeSell).
