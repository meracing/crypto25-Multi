# WebSocket Reconnection Fix - Complete

## üêõ **Problem Identified**

The bot was crashing after 5-7 hours with this error:
```
WebSocket is not open: readyState 0 (CONNECTING)
```

### Root Cause:
**Bitvavo's library has built-in auto-reconnect with only 100ms wait time!**

When WebSocket closes:
1. Bitvavo waits 100ms
2. Tries to resubscribe immediately
3. But WebSocket is still CONNECTING (readyState 0, not 1=OPEN)
4. Throws error and crashes the app

This happens because WebSocket reconnection takes longer than 100ms!

## ‚úÖ **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. **Global Error Handlers** (Lines 50-83)
Added handlers to catch Bitvavo's WebSocket errors and **prevent app crash**:

```javascript
process.on('unhandledRejection', ...)
process.on('uncaughtException', ...)
```

- Detects WebSocket reconnection errors
- Logs them but **doesn't crash**
- Allows reconnection logic to proceed

### 2. **Increased Wait Times**

**Before:**
- Error handler wait: 5 seconds
- Stabilization wait: 1 second
- Between subscriptions: 500ms

**After:**
- Error handler wait: **10 seconds** ‚úÖ
- Stabilization wait: **5 seconds** ‚úÖ
- Between subscriptions: **1 second** ‚úÖ

This gives WebSocket plenty of time to fully connect before attempting subscriptions.

### 3. **Enhanced Reconnection Logic** (Lines 700-780)

**Improvements:**
- Waits 5 seconds after `time()` call (was 1s)
- Wraps subscriptions in try-catch for "WebSocket not open" errors
- Retries subscription after 2s if WebSocket still connecting
- Logs all reconnection steps clearly

### 4. **Close Event Handler** (Lines 545-557)

Added explicit handler for WebSocket close events (separate from errors):
- Detects when connection closes cleanly
- Triggers reconnection after 10 seconds
- Prevents Bitvavo's 100ms auto-reconnect from racing

## üìä **Expected Behavior Now**

### When WebSocket Disconnects:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  [timestamp] WebSocket closed unexpectedly
‚è∞ Scheduling reconnection attempt in 10 seconds...
[waits 10 seconds - gives time for cleanup]
üîÑ Starting WebSocket reconnection process...
üîÑ Reconnecting WebSocket (attempt 1/10)...
Waiting 3000ms before reconnection attempt...
Initializing new WebSocket connection...
Waiting 5 seconds for WebSocket to fully stabilize...
Re-subscribing to ADA-EUR (1/3)...
  ‚úÖ ADA-EUR re-subscribed
[waits 1 second]
Re-subscribing to XRP-EUR (2/3)...
  ‚úÖ XRP-EUR re-subscribed
[waits 1 second]
Re-subscribing to SOL-EUR (3/3)...
  ‚úÖ SOL-EUR re-subscribed

‚úÖ [timestamp] WebSocket reconnected successfully!
‚úÖ All 3 markets re-subscribed and streaming
‚úÖ Trading resumed - monitoring for price updates
```

### If Bitvavo's 100ms Auto-Reconnect Fires:

```
‚ùå [timestamp] Uncaught Exception: Error: WebSocket is not open: readyState 0 (CONNECTING)
‚ö†Ô∏è  WebSocket connection error during Bitvavo auto-reconnect
‚ö†Ô∏è  Bot will recover automatically - continuing...
[No crash! Our reconnection logic takes over]
```

## üîç **Why This Happens After 5-7 Hours**

**Not API rate limits** - we're well under Bitvavo's limits:
- REST: 1000/minute (we do ~6/minute)
- WebSocket: 5000/second (we do ~3/second)

**Likely causes:**
1. **Idle timeout** - Bitvavo may close inactive connections
2. **Network blips** - ISP/WiFi temporary issues
3. **Bitvavo maintenance** - Regular server updates
4. **Keep-alive expiry** - Connection stale after hours

All of these are **normal** and should be handled gracefully (which they now are).

## üß™ **Testing the Fix**

### Monitor Script Enhanced:
The monitor.sh will now show:
```bash
[18:30:15] ‚ö†Ô∏è  DISCONNECT #1
    Websocket was closed
[18:30:25] üîÑ Reconnection attempt
    Starting WebSocket reconnection process
[18:30:35] ‚úÖ RECONNECT SUCCESS #1
    WebSocket reconnected successfully
```

### What to Look For:

‚úÖ **Success signs:**
- Bot continues running after disconnect
- Reconnection completes within 30 seconds
- Trades resume after reconnection
- No app crashes

‚ùå **Failure signs:**
- App exits/crashes
- "Max reconnection attempts reached"
- Trading stops permanently

## üìã **Long-Term Test Checklist**

Run for **48+ hours** and verify:

- [ ] Bot survives **5+ reconnection events**
- [ ] No crashes from WebSocket errors
- [ ] Trades execute correctly after reconnection
- [ ] Price data continues flowing
- [ ] Charts update properly
- [ ] Wallet balance stays accurate

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Restart bot** with new code:
   ```bash
   # Stop current bot (Ctrl+C)
   node --experimental-modules index.js
   ```

2. **Run monitor** in separate terminal:
   ```bash
   ./monitor.sh
   ```

3. **Let it run** for 24-48 hours

4. **Document results:**
   - How many disconnections?
   - Did all reconnections succeed?
   - Any crashes?

## üí° **Additional Notes**

- **Bitvavo library limitation**: The 100ms auto-reconnect can't be disabled, so we work around it
- **Error handlers are safety net**: They catch crashes but don't fix the root cause
- **Our reconnection logic**: Properly waits for connection to stabilize
- **Conservative approach**: Longer waits are better than racing with Bitvavo

## üîß **If Issues Persist**

If still getting crashes after these fixes:

1. **Check Bitvavo status**: https://status.bitvavo.com
2. **Increase wait times even more**:
   - Line 542: Change 10000 to 15000 (15s)
   - Line 729: Change 5000 to 8000 (8s)
3. **Reduce asset count**: Fewer assets = fewer subscriptions = less stress
4. **Check network stability**: WiFi issues? Use wired connection

---

**This fix should resolve the 5-7 hour crash issue!** The bot will now gracefully handle WebSocket disconnections and reconnect automatically. üéØ
